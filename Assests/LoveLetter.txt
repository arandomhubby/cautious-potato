To my baby,
My beautiful , wonderful, most amazing blessing in my life,
I know you told me no buying gifts, So I didn't. But I couldn't just pass the first Christmas just like that. couldn't find it in my heart, so I've put together a little game for you, a small thing compared to what you deserve, or what I would want to give to you. I hope you like it my cutie.

with that talked about, I want to tell you how much of an impact you've had on me my love, you fuel me to be better every passing day, you've brightened up my days with love, care, kindness, sweetness & much more, Giving me a reason to keep going every day. The joy I get when I see your name pop up on my phone is unmatched, and I would never, ever take you for granted.

Your Smile, Your Laugh, Your Love, Your genuineness, Your Radiant warmth, Everything About you completes me, like the last jigsaw puzzle piece, like the yin to a yang, like the moon & sun, I was made for loving you.

This is a small little project thats ALL for you, Made from scratch, hours put into it, I came into this NOT knowing how to do any of this shit btw, Almost Everything here's a first for me ,Its going to make you laugh at times, hopefully feel loved all the time, its a perfect mix of silly, love, and care.


Bahebek awii ya hayati, and Ill forever love you ya qamar. enti galby
