A Small Playlist that makes me feel.. you.

in no particular order

1- Sailor Song - was the first time I felt that, idk something about the happy vibes.
2- Hell N Back - Because I would go through hell and back for you my love
3- Chihiro     - you sent me a video of a biker dancing to a remix of this song and you were so inlove with it, the song stuck with me ever since, everytime it plays, I remember you and it puts a huge smile on my face.
4- Daises      - I dont even have to say anything here ;)
5- I wanna be yours - Same LOL
6- yumain o Leila - Even the flaws, you make better.
7- Addicted to you - are you my heroine, because Im addicted to you. (and youre my super hero)
8- Pixelated Kisses - The lyrics are just... hehe
9- Fable - Okay I had to lookup the lyrics here, the reason this is on the list, It makes me feel happy listening to the song, something about the guitar and voice (not lyrics), and I associate that happiness with you.
10- Baby Im yours - Every. Single. Word.
11- Best Friend - I Wanna be your favorite Boy. (everything in the song other than I wanna break your heart LMAO)
12- This I love - Okay this song takes the first place maybe, its as beautiful as your eyes. I sing this with my lungs out in the car with you on my mind haha.
13- So far so fake - still waiting for that recreation of yours smh...
14- Locked out of heaven - This was one of my all time favourites, I have no idea how you hijacked it but you did, and I love that.
15- Tear in my heart - the "you fell asleep in my car" part.. hehe.


and at last, if I had to choose one thing to listen to for the rest of my life
I would for sure choose your voice. even if its a 1 second loop of you coughing.
there's something about your voice thats so soothing, so beautiful, so warm.

I love you my baby.
